BUGS:
* "relative" arguments - is this even a thing? Shouldn't relativeness
  be decided by the instruction only?
* byte addressing won't work after linking - there needs to be special
 linkage case (address needs to be relocated by 2*n)

TODO:

* .global name, name, ...
* simplify +/- expressions for relocation
* preprocessor
  * .macro
  * .alias (.define?)

TO CLARIFY:

* overlays? (.ovl .len .max)
